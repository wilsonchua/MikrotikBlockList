# Mikrotik Cyber Threat Intel

This repository provides a compact Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) feed for Mikrotik routers in RSC format. Powered by AI/ML reinforcement learning, it delivers a minimal list of malicious IP addresses that blocks 60â€“70% of attacks. The small size ensures compatibility with most Mikrotik models and uses minimal CPU resources, making it an efficient security solution for your network. This is "Security for the 99%"
